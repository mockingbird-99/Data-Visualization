# (Airline Flight Data Investigation)
## by Jeremiah Tindana


## Dataset

The data set explored in this project is a 2007 flight data. 
The data set is large with over 7 million rows and 29 columns. 
It comtains 7 million instances of data on 2007 flights for 
features such as the month, day of the month, day of the week, 
flight carrirer (airline), destination, and origin. 
The data set can be obtained from 
[Havard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7#)


## Summary of Findings

The exploration generated at least 13 key findings

February has the least number of flights in a year
The last day of the month has significantly less number of flights
The last day of the month has significantly less number of flights
Almost 16% of all flights are carried by WN airlines.
41% of delays are carrier delays, 38.5% are caused by weather, 
and 19.9% are NAS. A very negligible percentage (about 0.1%) is caused by security issues.
ATL has the most flights originating and arriving.
Even though WN airlines have the highest customers, they have one 
of the least number of cancelled flights. MQ, YV and OH airlines have many cancelled flights
XE has the most diverted flights
B6 and CO the most NAS delays
EV airline has the highest number of carrier delays
AS Airline has th highest number of security delays
Quite a number of airlines have a lot of aircraft delays. UA and B6 have the highest.
There is noticeable correlation between Weather Delay and Late Aircraft Delay


## Key Insights for Presentation

The focus of this exploration was on the airlines (flight carriers). 
A few key insights were discovered.

Even though WN airlines had the highest patronage, we see that their 
number of cancelled flights were few. This could be further insight 
into the reason for their high patronage. This could infer that higher 
number of cancelled flights affects the patronage of airlines. However, 
studying WN airlines alone is not enough to arrive at such a conclusion.
Also, it makes sense that weather delay and late aircraft delay share 
some correlation. Carrier Delays and Late Aircraft Delays are not the 
cause of cancelled flights.
